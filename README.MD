### Struct for Big numbers in c++

There is always a limit on how big is the number we are using. But the integer limit in c++ is too small and something around $10^{18}$.

Just copy and paste this code before your main code and you don’t have to worry anymore. You can use numbers up to $10^{1000000}$.

You can use functions such as (+, -, *, /, %, +=, …) and even bitwise operations like (and, xor, …).

You can Print your bignum easily like an integer.
